## Our goal

### cards with explanation of the different sections

### Topic I am not sure where to place
1. FiftyOne brain  - it mixes both user guide, how-tos, and reference all throughout the docS

There are two options
1. Give brain its own doc site
2. Break apart the docs into two different directories
    1. Conceptual for the brain
    2. How to do stuff with the brain
