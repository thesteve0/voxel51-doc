## Our goal

The structure and approach to the doc will be using best practices from the tech writing community. 

A good summary of those practices are found on the [Diataxis diataxis.webpsite](https://diataxis.fr/)

The main idea to understand right now is the 4 main types of documentation. Mixing two different purposes
in one doc leads to confusion and more cognitive load for the user.

This site is already being built and deployed using CI/CD


### Cards with explanation of the different sections

There should be a brief intro on this page and then perhaps cards desribing the top level elements of the TOC. 

After the cards we can put a bit more text with some suggested actions. 

### Examples of inspirational sites
Not all the features from every site but at least a piece I think is good
